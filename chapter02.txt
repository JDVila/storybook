If you've ever had the opportunity to go to the American Museum of Natural History, there is a fossil of a Narwhal that is quite impressive. I have a cousin who thinks that Narwhals aren't real, so what I like to do, is send her pictures of Narhwal fossils, and then she will reply "No, those are sea unicorns, you are so silly."
This one time, when I was 6 years old, I thought I found a wedding ring on the beach, but then it turned out to be a used blowpop, and my mom yelled at me for picking up gross garbage covered in sand.
